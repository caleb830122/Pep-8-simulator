This is the 5 November 2020 version of the GUI for the Pep/8 PRJ#02 Program.

To run the program, run Pep8GUIDriver.java in the view package. Once ran, you will see a GUI pop up on your desktop.
Once there, you can input random text into the "Object Code" and "Input" text areas, then press the buttons at the top
of the window to get a bullet-point list that plans out how each button action will work with the Controller class.

Test classes are located in the test package. Run JLabelTextAreaTest to check that the JUnit 5 tests all pass. There will
be more GUI-related test classes to make once the Controller class gets implemented.
